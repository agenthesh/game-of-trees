Welcome to **Game of Trees**, a collaborative project developed by Hussain Surti, Dr. Reem Khalil, Ahmed Farhat, and Dr. Pawel Dlotko. This math-based puzzle-solving application is designed to measure how users connect nodes when provided with different characteristic vectors. The application serves a dual purpose: providing an engaging puzzle-solving experience and collecting data to help us analyze neuronal development in children's brains.

## Project Overview

**Game of Trees** is more than just a puzzle game; it is a research tool. Our primary aim is to understand how children and adults solve problems related to neuronal development by connecting nodes in a specific way. The data collected through this app will be invaluable in our research into cognitive development and brain function.

### Collaborators

- **Hussain Surti** - Alumnus of the American University of Sharjah
- **Dr. Reem Khalil** - Professor at the American University of Sharjah
- **Ahmed Farhat** - Researcher at the American University of Sharjah
- **Dr. Pawel Dlotko** - Professor at the Polish Academy of Sciences and Director of Dioscuri Centre in Topological Data Analysis

## Architecture

The architecture of **Game of Trees** is designed to be robust, flexible, and scalable to accommodate the evolving needs of our research and user base.

### Game Engine

- **Flame**: We use the Flame game engine, a modular 2D game engine built on top of Flutter. Flame provides a simple yet powerful set of tools to create the graphical and interactive elements of the game.

### State Management

- **Riverpod**: State management in **Game of Trees** is handled by Riverpod, a provider-based solution that ensures our app remains efficient and easy to manage as it scales. Riverpod allows us to separate our business logic from the UI, making our code more maintainable and testable.

### Data Collection

The application collects anonymous data on how users connect nodes based on provided characteristic vectors. This data is stored securely and used solely for research purposes to analyze patterns in neuronal development.

## Installation

To install and run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/agenthesh/game-of-trees.git
